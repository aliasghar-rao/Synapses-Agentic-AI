### Financial Statement Analysis

```
User: I have my financial statements but I don't know how to interpret them. What should I be looking for?

Accounts Manager: Financial statement analysis is one of the most powerful tools for understanding your business performance and making informed decisions. Let me guide you through reading and interpreting your financial statements like a professional.

**Understanding Your Financial Statements**

## The Three Core Financial Statements

### 1. Profit & Loss Statement (Income Statement)
**Purpose:** Shows your business performance over a period (month, quarter, year)

**Key Components:**
- **Revenue/Sales**: Money earned from your core business activities
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs to produce your product/service
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue minus COGS (shows efficiency of core operations)
- **Operating Expenses**: Costs to run your business (rent, salaries, marketing)
- **Operating Income**: Gross profit minus operating expenses
- **Net Income**: Final profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest

### 2. Balance Sheet
**Purpose:** Shows your financial position at a specific point in time

**Key Components:**
- **Assets**: What your business owns (cash, inventory, equipment)
- **Liabilities**: What your business owes (loans, accounts payable)
- **Equity**: Owner's stake in the business (assets minus liabilities)

### 3. Cash Flow Statement
**Purpose:** Shows how cash moves in and out of your business

**Key Components:**
- **Operating Activities**: Cash from day-to-day business operations
- **Investing Activities**: Cash from buying/selling assets
- **Financing Activities**: Cash from loans, investments, or owner contributions

## Key Financial Ratios and What They Mean

### Profitability Ratios

**1. Gross Profit Margin**
```
Formula: (Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100
Example: ($50,000 ÷ $100,000) × 100 = 50%
```
**What it means:** For every dollar of sales, you keep 50 cents after direct costs
**Good benchmark:** Varies by industry, but generally 20-50%+
**Red flags:** Declining trend, below industry average

**2. Net Profit Margin**
```
Formula: (Net Income ÷ Revenue) × 100
Example: ($10,000 ÷ $100,000) × 100 = 10%
```
**What it means:** Your bottom-line profitability after all expenses
**Good benchmark:** 5-20% depending on industry
**Red flags:** Negative margins, declining trend

**3. Operating Margin**
```
Formula: (Operating Income ÷ Revenue) × 100
Example: ($15,000 ÷ $100,000) × 100 = 15%
```
**What it means:** Profitability from core business operations
**Good benchmark:** 10-20% for most businesses
**Red flags:** Lower than net margin (indicates non-operating income dependency)

### Liquidity Ratios

**1. Current Ratio**
```
Formula: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
Example: $30,000 ÷ $15,000 = 2.0
```
**What it means:** You have $2 in current assets for every $1 of short-term debt
**Good benchmark:** 1.5-3.0 (varies by industry)
**Red flags:** Below 1.0 (liquidity problems), above 5.0 (too much idle cash)

**2. Quick Ratio (Acid Test)**
```
Formula: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities
Example: ($30,000 - $10,000) ÷ $15,000 = 1.33
```
**What it means:** Ability to pay short-term debts without selling inventory
**Good benchmark:** 1.0 or higher
**Red flags:** Below 1.0 indicates potential cash flow problems

### Efficiency Ratios

**1. Accounts Receivable Turnover**
```
Formula: Annual Revenue ÷ Average Accounts Receivable
Example: $500,000 ÷ $50,000 = 10 times per year
```
**What it means:** How quickly you collect money from customers
**Good benchmark:** Higher is better, varies by industry
**Red flags:** Declining trend indicates collection problems

**2. Inventory Turnover**
```
Formula: Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory
Example: $300,000 ÷ $50,000 = 6 times per year
```
**What it means:** How quickly you sell and replace inventory
**Good benchmark:** Varies widely by industry
**Red flags:** Very low turnover indicates slow-moving inventory

**3. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**
```
Formula: (Accounts Receivable ÷ Annual Revenue) × 365
Example: ($50,000 ÷ $500,000) × 365 = 36.5 days
```
**What it means:** Average days to collect payment from customers
**Good benchmark:** 30-45 days for most businesses
**Red flags:** Increasing trend, much higher than payment terms

### Leverage Ratios

**1. Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
```
Formula: Total Debt ÷ Total Equity
Example: $100,000 ÷ $200,000 = 0.5
```
**What it means:** You have 50 cents of debt for every dollar of equity
**Good benchmark:** Below 1.0 for most small businesses
**Red flags:** Above 2.0 indicates high leverage risk

**2. Debt Service Coverage Ratio**
```
Formula: Net Operating Income ÷ Total Debt Service
Example: $50,000 ÷ $30,000 = 1.67
```
**What it means:** Ability to service debt payments from operations
**Good benchmark:** Above 1.25 (many lenders require 1.20+)
**Red flags:** Below 1.0 indicates inability to service debt

## Trend Analysis: The Power of Comparison

### Month-over-Month Analysis
Look for patterns in:
- **Revenue growth**: Is it consistent or volatile?

### Year-over-Year Analysis
Compare same periods to eliminate seasonal effects:

### Industry Benchmarking
Compare your ratios to:
- **Industry averages**: Available from trade associations
- **Competitors**: Public company data if available
- **Best practices**: Top performers in your industry

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Immediate Concerns

- **Current ratio below 1.0**: Can't pay short-term obligations
- **Declining gross margins**: Pricing pressure or cost increases
- **Increasing DSO**: Customer payment problems

### Warning Signs
- **Revenue growth without profit growth**: Unprofitable expansion
- **High inventory levels**: Slow-moving or obsolete stock
- **Increasing debt levels**: Potential leverage problems
- **Declining working capital**: Liquidity squeeze developing

### Strategic Concerns
- **Flat or declining revenue**: Market or competitive issues
- **Margin compression**: Pricing pressure or inefficiency

Operating Expenses:
  Salaries                       $80,000
  Rent                          $24,000

**2. Delay Cash Outflows**
- **Negotiate payment terms**: Contact vendors to request extended payment terms
- **Prioritize critical payments**: Pay essential suppliers and employees first

- **Eliminate unprofitable products/services**: Focus on high-margin offerings
- **Implement value-based pricing**: Price based on customer value, not just cost
- **Regular price reviews**: Adjust prices to maintain margins

**Long-Term Cash Flow Management**

- **13-week rolling forecast**: Predict cash needs for next quarter
- **Scenario planning**: Model best case, worst case, and most likely scenarios
- **Monthly updates**: Revise forecasts based on actual results

**2. Working Capital Optimization**

Based on what you've shared, here's what I recommend you do immediately:

**This Week:**
1. **Create a 13-week cash flow forecast** to understand exactly when you'll face shortfalls
2. **Contact your top 5 customers** with outstanding invoices and request immediate payment
3. **Reach out to your 3 most important suppliers** to negotiate extended payment terms
4. **Apply for a business line of credit** to provide a safety net for future cash needs

**Next 90 Days:**

2. **Implement automated collection processes** to improve efficiency
3. **Review pricing strategy** to ensure adequate margins
4. **Establish ongoing cash flow monitoring** systems

**Warning Signs to Monitor:**

- Increasing reliance on credit lines

**When to Seek Additional Help:**
